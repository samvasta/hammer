# Hammer

It is tradition for blacksmiths to build their own tools.

In building their tool set, the smith practices their craft and gains a deeper understanding of each tool - what went into its production, how and why it functions. The smith's hammer is built to fit the smith's hands and meet their needs exactly.

The smith's hammer may not make them a better smith, but does make their craft more enjoyable.

I am not a smith, I am a programmer. I work with keyboards and this *my* hammer.
